## Research Focus

My research focuses on developing advanced machine learning methods for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems, with a particular emphasis on super-resolution techniques for multi-scale flows. I work at the intersection of scientific computing, deep learning, and fluid mechanics.

## Current Projects

### Taylor Series Error Correction Network

Developing neural networks that can efficiently correct discretization errors in numerical PDE solutions using principles from Taylor series expansion. This approach enables high-accuracy solutions at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional fine-grid simulations.

### MegaFlow2D Dataset

Created a parametric dataset for benchmarking machine learning super-resolution methods in CFD simulations. This dataset facilitates the development and evaluation of neural network architectures for fluid flow prediction and enhancement.

### Adaptive Local Domain Decomposition

Working on techniques to decompose large-scale fluid simulation domains into manageable local regions for more efficient processing by neural networks, while maintaining physical consistency across region boundaries.
