# Wenzhuo Xu
wzxu [at] cmu [dot] edu

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Christopher McComb](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mccomb-christopher.html) and [Prof. Noelia Grande Gutiérrez](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/grande-gutierrez-noelia.html). Also check out my fellow group members of [Design Research Collective](https://cmudrc.github.io/) and [BiosiMMlab](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/faculty/gutierrez-biosimm-lab.html). My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and computational fluid dynamics, with a focus on developing data-driven methods for the super-resolution of multi-scale flows.
