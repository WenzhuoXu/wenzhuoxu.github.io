# How to Update Your Profile Image

To update your profile image for the website:

1. Replace the placeholder file at `assets/images/self_image.jpg` with Image 4 from our conversation (the one with you standing on an overlook with an umbrella)

2. Make sure the image is named exactly `self_image.jpg`

3. After adding the image, you can delete:
   - The placeholder file `assets/images/self_image.jpg.placeholder`
   - The file at `assets/profile_image.jpg.placeholder`
   - This instructions file

4. Push the changes to GitHub to update your live website

Your profile image will automatically appear in the author profile sidebar on all pages of your website.
